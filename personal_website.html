          As a student who played sports, had many friends, and was smart, I can only remember those times as not giving
          it all I had. Between distraction, lack of purpose, and no path to take, I felt as if I were a small fish in a
          vast ocean with nowhere to swim. Freshman, sophomore, and junior years are a blur that feels more like an
          insignificant blip than memories I choose to cherish. My final year is when I began to care about my future.
          These were the firsts signs of becoming someone Who wanted to forge his own path.</p>

          Senior year, I was starting my college search and looking for opportunities. I had gone to this elementary so
          naturally they entered my name to the scholarship raffle. Raffle winners, which consisted of myself and three
          other seniors were to speak in the 5th grade class rooms.Then based of popularity the kids would vote on the
          winner of the $500 dollar scholarship. My experience speaking with those kids was profoundly and deeply
          impactful. In each class I found bright smiles and mountains of hope that could endure any storm or climb any
          ocean crest. I realized that our age gap was only a formality of time and we were all the same internally.
          Only difference was I was leaving that stage of life and they were coming into it. Seeing them was a force
          that convinced me to have that kind of hope in myself and what I could do. Winning the major vote of those
          kids means the world to me because as I had seen them, they also had seen me.</p>

        <p class="story">
          Where I turned opportunity into desired outcomes. Summer 2018 the school offered an acceptance program where
          underprivileged students could get there feet wet and get a taste of the university pace. That summer
          something
          clicked, I wanted to and did thrive. Taking hold of my own path I put in time, effort, and passion into my
          work,
          time management and my success. Many moments in university changed the philosophy that I used to define my
          life,
          and most importantly transformed the self expression of work ethic. I recognized the importance of a positive
          outcome and knew that the time would be well spent if I continuously engaged every single aspect of the era.
          This idea is still a core of how I think when leaving an interaction, idea, or subject. In my four years of
          attendance at the university I understood that learning or gathering information, for educated and informed
          decisions should not stop. Continuously learning and reaching new heights is a fundamental pillar of success.
          For this reason in my own story I will be continuously growing my skills, educated, and higher learning. So I
          may effectively have the correct methods of running down a better path.
